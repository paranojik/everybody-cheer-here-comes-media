						- You’ve probably heard there’s a lot going on around Media in Drupal 8 recently.
						<br />
						- How many of you already use Media in your projects or are familiar with it?
						<br />
						- In this talk we’d like to show what the fuss is all about.
						<br />
						- A huge amount of work has been invested in the recent years and we finally have a really flexible architecture and powerful ecosystem for handling media.

					<aside class="notes">
						- We’d like to start by giving some context about the problems we faced using Drupal in the past and then proceed with how these were addressed in Drupal 8 and how the Media entity ecosystem brought all this to a whole new level. We expect that everyone here knows how to download and enable a module from drupal.org.
						<br />
						- So basically, we’ll start from scratch and show you how step-by-step how we can easily improve media handling in Drupal 8 from a very simple example and gradually add more complexity.
						<br />
						- We’ll take a look at the base Media module and what it provides, how this enhances the embedding functionality, then proceed with the entity browser module, dropzone for bulk uploads and finally show two cropping solutions. There will also be some time at the end for some discussion.

						We strongly believe that media is at the heart of a great website experience. Everybody loves having big images, videos, audio files on their websites - this is what brings a website to life for your users. Let’s see some specific issues in Drupal 7:
						<ul>
							<li>So when you installed drupal 7 out of the box… what kind of functionality did you get? Well, you didn’t really get much. You didn’t get an editor and there was no proper media management.</li>
							<li>Basically there were just image and file fields and the interactions with files are very limited, that means that we cannot add any metadata (like caption, copyright info) do them (because they are not entities).</li>

					<h2>Have no fear, contrib is here!</h2>
					<aside class="notes">
						… but that’s all right, have no fear, contrib is here! Because Drupal is based on a modular architecture with a small Drupal core, which holds the basic functionality and contrib modules to complement it… that means that people will develop contribution modules that add extra functionality.

					<p>
						… that’s “ok”... because of modular architecture
					</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						- The most popular by far to handle media is of course, the Media module. <br/>
						It offered decent functionality, in combination with many other modules, like Media oEmbed - to embed youtube or vimeo videos, Media CKEditor and Entity Embed… it was still a bit buggy with WYSIWYG Editors but it’s a pretty decent solution. And some distributions like Penopoly use it.

					<aside class="notes">
						- So first let’s see what Drupal 8 looks like out-of the-box. What we’re looking at now is a clean Drupal installation using the standard installation profile so most of the stuff is already preconfigured.
						<br />
						- Let’s try and add an article now.
						<br />
						...
						<br />
						- What do we as site builders / users get from Drupal from a fresh install? We can host images locally, we can upload images in bulk with the new HTML5l file upload element. We have a file listing. We have usage tracking. Which means that every time you reference an image or embed it in wysiwyg Drupal will increase a counter for that file.
						We have basic embedding of images in wysiwyg. But works only for images. You can’t embed videos with that. You can set a caption, alt text and alignment.

						- Amazing right? Or is it? <br />
						- We still can’t even reuse images. Embedding only works for images and even that without cropping or resizing. <br />
						- Files are not fully fledged entities so whatever attributes they currently support - that’s it. You’re not able to add additional custom fields to files or images. (for example copyright information). <br />
						- What about videos? How do we link videos from youtube or vimeo? Or images from Flick or… you name it? How can we embed these kind of media? Do we have or want modules that create a field type for each and every one of them like we did in drupal 7?

						- A plan was drafted for generic media handling. Later next year at Drupal camp NYC the media initiative was formed and a huge effort has been undertaken - unify media handling  and provide a generic and versatile base for all kinds of media solutions. This is how media_entity was born. <br />
						- Main goals: Media library, reuse of images, upload images to your server, remote media from services like youtube, flickr, Generic handling of media with embedding, cropping and metadata. <br />

						- The Media entity module provides a 'base' entity for storing media. This is a normal content entity (just like node) which can reference all kinds of media-objects (local files - meaning on your server, YouTube videos, Tweets, Instagram photos, ...). Media entity provides a relation between Drupal and the actual media resource. You can reference this entity within any other Drupal entity via the Entity reference field. <br />
						- Media introduces the notion of Media sources. Media sources are plugins that implement the actual retrieval of the linked media object and its metadata and propagate storage to Drupal fields. <br />
						- On youtube you have a video a description thumbnail… In the past it was hard to use that. There was no standardized way of fetching and exposing that data on the site. With media entity we now have metadata fields and you can map those from the Source to local fields.” Tweet author, id, retweet count,...

					<aside class="notes">
						- After the official media initiative was announced at DrupalCon New Orleans work has begun to bring the media_entity into core. It is now called only “Media”. It’s a stable but hidden module. It is hidden because it actually doesn’t do much on it’s own. So far it only provides support for local images and documents (pdf,...) and a lot of the usability stuff needs to be addressed. So it is still up to contrib to leverage the media APIs and extend the functionality just as before. <br />
						- Media_entity is committed to core as stable but because a lot of the contrib is not yet ported to the new API and the upgrade path is not ready yet it is a hidden module and a lot of the usability stuff like sensible defaults, formatters and widgets are not in place yet. Media is an API module and does nothing special on it’s own. <br />
						- Currently the media initiative is also working on porting the existing media_entity ecosystem to be compatible with the recent changes in core. If you’re a developer and you want to help with you can join the sprints which are happening here at DCon vienna on Friday. <br />
						- But let’s not underestimate the impact this has on the overall progress of Drupal. The task and ultimate goal of core is not only to provide functionality but most importantly to set standards and provide APIs that contrib can then follow along, extend that functionality and provide richer customized experiences.

					<aside class="notes">
						- Media source plugins are usually implemented in separate modules. (image and documents are in core 8.4).
						- So.. when we want to create a new media type we have to specify the media source and optionally additional metadata mapping and/or other source specific settings.

					<aside class="notes">Enable instagram and media
							- So let’s see on our example what happens when we enable the new Media module in Drupal 8.4. We have to do this either via drush as Media is a hidden module, or by enabling a module that depends on Media,... oh and of course after that you need to clear the cache! :) <br />
							- If we now go to the Admin -> Structure path we see that have a new menu Item “Media types” and under that “Image and Document” is already defined for us. This is a replacement for the traditional “File” and “Image” fields. <br />
							- Let’s try and add another Media type. We’ll add Videos using the video_embed_field module which defines a Media source for referencing remote videos (Youtube, Vimeo,...). The module is already enabled for this example.

						Let’s see it in action.
						1.) After downloading and installing the Entity Embed module and its dependencies, navigate to Configuration -> Content Authoring -> Text editor embed buttons and click on Add embed button <br />
						2.) On this page you will see that there is already one embed button created - this is used to embed nodes and is automatically created upon install. <br />
						3.) In our example we’re creating a button to embed images and videos, let’s call it Multimedia.<br />
					  	4.) We will be using an entity browser to upload and reuse images, so we select that one.<br />
						5.) As a tip, we’d always suggest you add an icon to your embed buttons in order to distinguish them. If you don’t do that, the icon will be set by default to the E icon and might be confusing for the user when having different embed buttons in the toolbar.<br />
						6.) Now let’s navigate to the text editors screen and add our newly created button to the toolbar.<br />
						7.) Make sure to mark the checkbox “Display embedded entities”<br />
						8.) And also make sure that the special tags are whitelisted in the Allowed HTML tags area<br />

						9.) What happens behind the scenes is that every entity that we embed with the Entity Embed module  gets converted to an entity of this type, with the corresponding attributes<br />

						11.) With this we are all set. Your editors can now navigate to any content form that uses the “Basic HTML” text format and start using the button, for example we can embed an image to an Article node<br />

					<h1>Crop API</h1>
					<ul>
						<li>Storage for all cropping solutions</li>
						<li>Handling crops based on:
							<ul>
								<li>Region - storing a crop area</li>
								<li>Reference point</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
						- The Crop API provides storage for “hopefully” all cropping solutions. It is able to handle crops based on region and reference point concepts. We won’t get into details, but rather show two different implementations based on the Crop API.<br />
						- Cropping information is saved per file. The problem is that the image style system does not have knowledge about the usage of the file.

				<section data-state="logo-position-normal">
					<h1>Image widget crop</h1>
					<ul>
						<li>Specify exact crop region</li>
						<li>Manual - It’s a field widget</li>
						<li>A lot of manual work if we have to define many crops</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
						Provides an interface for using the features of the Crop API. This element provides an UX for using a crop on all fields images or file elements. This module has particularity to purpose capability to crop the same image by “Crop type” configured. It’s very useful for editorial sites or media management sites.

					<h1>Focal point</h1>
					<ul>
						<li>Crop around a selected point</li>
						<li>Semi-Automatic</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
						With focal point you want to say: this is the part of the image that has the most information - the part of the image I really want to be the center of the cropped version. And drupal then makes sure that that part of the image remains visible in the cropped version.
